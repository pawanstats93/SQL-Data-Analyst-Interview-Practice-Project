# SQL-Data-Analyst-Interview-Practice-Project
This project contains SQL interview questions and solutions designed for Tier-2 Data Analyst roles (2–5 years experience).   The dataset simulates a retail sales environment with customers, employees, orders, products, and historical transactions.

## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates intermediate-level SQL skills through a structured set of
interview-oriented queries built on a retail sales dataset. The objective of this project
is to practice and showcase real-world SQL problem-solving commonly expected in
Tier-2 Data Analyst interviews.

The dataset consists of customer information, employee hierarchy, product catalog,
current orders, and historical (archived) orders. Using these tables, a variety of SQL
queries were created to analyze customer behavior, sales performance, product trends,
and data quality issues.

The queries cover essential SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, subqueries,
window functions, date-based analysis, and NULL handling. Each query is written with
clear business intent, optimized logic, and concise explanations to ensure readability
and interview readiness.

This repository is designed to serve both as an interview preparation resource and as
a portfolio project that reflects practical SQL skills applicable to real business
scenarios.
